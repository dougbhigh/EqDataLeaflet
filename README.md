# EqDataLeaflet
### Phase 1
- Leaflet and Mapbox used in conjunction with Javascript and HTML to create maps of earthquake data from the US Geological Survey.  Magnitude of earthquake is reflected in size of data marker and depth by color (darker = deeper).  Popups added to each event to show details of the earthquake.
- (USGS data comes as JSON via URL and changeable within the Javascript (for example https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson provides data for the past wekk)).

- Phase 1 expanded by adding an overlay of tectonic plates as well as variety of base maps.
- Layer control added to choose base map and wether or not to include the earthquake data and/or tectonic plate overlays.
